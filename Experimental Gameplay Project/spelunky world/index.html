		<p>It's time for another introduction, it would seem. My name is Eirik, but I'm known to many as "chiptune artist" Phlogiston.</p>
		<p><strong>I will be supplying music and sound design for Spelunky XBLA.</strong></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.strotch.net/">You're welcome to check out my website.</a></p>
		<p>I've
been working on this score for several months now, and it's been a
blast! I'm not going to write a ton about it, at least not at this
point, but I wanted to show off a little bit of it, to give you guys an
idea of what it'll sound like.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.derekyu.com/spelunky/Spelunky_teaser.mp3">TEASER MP3 - medley of various songs from the game</a></p>
		<p>Basically,
I wanted the soundtrack to be a mix of retro-sounding videogame music
and more modern-sounding music utilizing actual instruments. I guess I
imagined it would sound like a mixture of FM-based music (arcade, SEGA
Genesis/Mega Drive, 80's music), sample/tracker based music (Amiga/90's
demoscene) and just regular pop/rock (70's/80's/90's). Hopefully you
guys can tell me if it came through or not.</p>

		<h2><img src="index_files/goldidol-xbla.png" alt="">Mar 28th, 2010 - Lighting the Way</h2>
		<p>Derek
wasn't lying in that last post. Things are indeed moving along quite
well as we continue to work on the Xbox 360 version. It has been quite
exciting to see the project evolve from just a few sprites displaying
on the screen to a game that is unmistakably Spelunky.</p>
		<p>I
guess this is supposed to be my official introduction or something! I'm
Andy, the guy helping Derek with Spelunky. As there are only two of us,
I'm wearing many hats on the project, but one of my main jobs is as
graphics programmer. </p>
		<p>I thought it would be kind of neat to
give a quick run-down of how the dynamic lighting works in Spelunky.
This isn't going to be too technical because 1) I'm not sure how
interesting that would actually be; and 2) I'm not sure how accurate I
would be explaining the technical aspect. (I mean really, I did spend
the last five years as a reclusive wooden toy designer...)</p>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="index_files/normals-news.jpg" alt="Spelunky XBLA Normal Maps" vspace="10" border="0" hspace="10"></div>
		<p>First,
the normal maps are rendered to a texture. For those not in the know,
the normal map tilts the surface of each pixel so the light will bounce
off them at different angles. So the lavender color you see above
indicates a flat surface facing the screen, while all the colored edges
indicate different tilts at different angles.</p>
		<p>If you are
wondering why there isn't much detail in Spelunky Man, it's because the
graphics card actually generates simple normal maps for all the active
entities in the game. This not only saves time (because we don't have
to generate normal maps for every frame of animation of all the
sprites) but it also ensures that the lighting won't make the surface
details of each sprite hard to see. It does allow for a nice rim
lighting effect on the sprites, so they still are able to blend nicely
into the scene.</p>

		<h2><img src="index_files/goldidol-xbla.png" alt="">Mar 8th, 2010 - Spelunky XBLA Screenshots!</h2>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://spelunkyworld.com/xbla.html"><img src="index_files/spelunky-xbla-01-news.jpg" alt="Spelunky XBLA Screenshot 1" vspace="10" border="0" hspace="10"></a></div>
		<p>We've
been working hard over here at Mossmouth Headquarters (a mossy stump
fit for two or maybe three!). No slackin'! And we think things are
coming along pretty good.</p>
		<p>Good enough, in fact, that I'd like to show off some of what we've been doing on <a href="http://spelunkyworld.com/xbla.html">Spelunky for Xbox Live Arcade</a>!
As you can see, we're spending a lot of time making the game look new
and beautiful for XBLA. Mr. Andy Hull is helping me add all kinds of
new graphical effects to make the game pop on your t.v. screen. Bombs
will send shadows bouncing off of the walls, and if, for example,
rubble falls into a small lake, it will send ripples dancing across the
water's surface.</p>
		<p>Those are just some of things that are
making us so excited about this version of Spelunky. We're doing
everything we can to make it feel new, and totally made for the Xbox
360... without losing any of the original game's depth. Please let us
know what you think about our work, and keep checking back, because now
that we're on a roll (like a boulder) I'll be updating the site more
often! See ya!</p>

		<h2><img src="index_files/goldidol.gif" alt="">Dec 25th, 2009 - Version 1.1, Source Code Released!</h2>
		<a href="http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?topic=514.0"><img style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0pt 140px 5px 10px; float: right;" src="index_files/spelunkyman01-thumb.jpg" alt="Spelunky Man"></a>
		<p>Happy
Holidays, everyone! I said I would release the source code before the
end of 2009, didn't I? Not only that, but version 1.1 is out as well.
This release has a lot of bug-fixes in it. It also adds some extended
stat-tracking. If you've ever wondered how many times you've been
killed by arrow traps or how many damsels you've saved, now you can
find out - just open up "stats.txt" after exiting the game. Both v1.1
and the source can be downloaded <a href="http://spelunkyworld.com/original.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Things
are going very well with Xbox 360 development - I'm really enjoying
working on this platform and I'm excited about what you guys will
think. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it for now! Rest
assured that the new year will bring more news on this front.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, enjoy 1.1 and also the source code!  I can't wait to see what you guys come up with.  Please use the <a href="http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?board=6.0">Spelunky Source forums</a> to discuss it!</p>

		<h2><img src="index_files/goldidol.gif" alt="">Sep 1st, 2009 - Welcome to Spelunky World!</h2>
		<p>Hey there! Welcome to the new Spelunky website! Methinks it was about time to move the game to its own digs on the web.</p>
		<p>Aside
from kicking off the new site, I'm pleased to make some very exciting
announcements here today. First off, version 1.0 is finally ready!
That's right, the game can finally come out of its "beta" status. This
version has a lot of bug fixes and some new surprises, so <a href="http://spelunkyworld.com/original.html">check it out</a>.</p>
		<p>Secondly,
and this one's a big one - Spelunky is making its way to Xbox Live
Arcade in 2010! Yep, and it's going to be much more than a straight
port of the PC game - I'm planning on stuffing it with new graphics,
audio, and other features for XBLA users. With all the other great
independent games on XBLA or coming to it, I'm hopeful that Spelunky
will feel right at home there. I think it's a cool platform and I'm
excited about what I'll be able to do to make the game special.</p>
		<p>Regarding
the inevitable question of whether the XBLA flavor of Spelunky will
also be available on PC or any other systems: I don't have any plans
for it right now. The original Spelunky doesn't need replacing, in my
opinion, and I'll continue to support it as a free title. Not only
that, but I'm planning on opening up the source code before the end of
the year so that people can modify the game to their heart's content.
For now, head over to the <a href="http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?board=3.0">Spelunky forums</a> to discuss the game and share levels!</p>
		<p>Thanks
to everyone who supported the game thus far - I've been overwhelmed by
the response and where it's taken the project. As always, please give
me your feedback on everything. Stay tuned to this site and <a href="http://twitter.com/mossmouth">my Twitter</a> if you want to be up-to-date. Happy Spelunky-ing!</p>
