			<p><b>By M&amp;R</b> | January 19, 2010 </p>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Yes, we’re still alive!</p>
<p>The the past few months have been quite stressful and busy, with a
constant stream of things coming up that required our
attention…resulting in us never having the time and/or energy to
properly make with the blogging. </p>
<p>To jump straight to the crux of the post: we’ve decided to put Robotology on hold for the immediate future. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent the end of 2009 trying to prepare a “vertical slice” of the
game in order to meet a grant milestone; this was a rather
soul-crushing process of cutting, cutting, and cutting some more, until
the game that remained was not the exciting, interesting game we are
determined to make. Realizing this made us aware that something was
wrong, and that action was needed in order to move us back on track.</p>
<p>Now, obviously some amount of compromise is required in order to
actually ship a game, we’re quite aware of the dangers of a “ship when
it’s done” mentality and Duke Nukem Forever and all that. Don’t worry,
we’re on it.</p>
<p>The problem is that the features we would have had to cut or
simplify in order to release the game in the near future are basically
the entire list of what we set out to achieve: physics-based
locomotion, vector-graphics animation system, powerful and friendly
editors. When you remove these, you’re left with yet another
physics-based platformer which neither of us was really interested in
working on or playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for Metanet Software’s existence is to provide a channel
through which we can release our work, so that we can be able to make
the games we want to make. </p>
<p>Obviously we would love to release a new game every year, or every
month, but at the same time we would both prefer to never release
another game than to release something we aren’t happy with and don’t
love. </p>
<p>As we worked we saw how far we were from realizing the game we had
envisioned, and how little time we had left before our deadline, which
put us under a lot of stress; a combination of “it’s been so long since
we released a game!” and our own impatience at still not being able to
play this game we’ve been collectively dreaming of for years.</p>
<p>This stress made it harder to concentrate and work well, which began
a feedback loop of more and more stress and less and less good work
getting done.</p>
<p>At some point we realized that we <em>don’t</em> have “little time”
left, in fact we have our entire lives — maybe we don’t need to kill
ourselves to get this done, especially if we’re not going to be happy
with the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we were struggling with Robotology through November and
December, the proverbial “carrot on the stick” was that once it was
completed, we would be able to spend 2010 working on the many small
experiments and game ideas that have been accumulating in our “to do”
lists over the years.</p>
<p>We decided that instead of trying to press on with Robotology, it
would be better for us and for the project if it was put on hold for
the time being, allowing us to take a break from it by working on those
small projects (one of which is prototyping <a href="http://www.officeyeti.org/">Office Yeti</a>). Exciting!</p>
<p>The realization that we maybe needed to take a break from Robotology
was even more frustrating because of how great everyone else is doing;
it seemed as though all of our friends and peers were excelling in 2009
and accelerating into 2010, while we were stuck in a morass. We’re so
inspired by the amazing work our friends are doing, and it was
difficult to admit we weren’t getting much done with our project. It
was indescribably heartbreaking to make the decision to put Robotology
on hold: it meant shelving our dream game, and accepting the harsh
reality that we had failed, and that we’ve let people down.</p>
<p>Andy Schatz’s recent experience with Monaco, <a href="http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/side-projects/whats-up-with-dinosauria">as detailed on his blog</a>,
has somewhat reassured us that this is the right decision to make — or
at least that it isn’t necessarily a terribly bad course of action to
take! Let’s hope <img src="metablog_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, the beginning of 2010 was an extremely low point in the
history of Metanet Software, but since then we’ve come to realize that
this situation isn’t really so bad: we’ve learned <em>a lot</em>, and have an incredible amount of useful tech which will serve us well in other projects. </p>
<p>Most importantly, once our decision had sunk in, we found that we
were excited and inspired, and that we both had a renewed energy toward
making games. </p>
<p>We can’t wait to start expanding some of our ideas and experiments
over the next few months, which will hopefully result in some new, fun
projects. Plus, Robotology isn’t gone for good — now that it’s no
longer an albatross, we find ourselves getting excited about it again
and wanting to work on some of the remaining problems/challenges. Many
of the outstanding tasks, like the level and character editors, were
perfectly suited to be stand-alone projects, and we’re looking forward
to working on them. </p>
<p>Being able to return to these projects whenever we get an idea or
insight rather than having to have solved everything like, yesterday —
being free of the constant pressure and stress of getting it finished
ASAP — really feels great. </p>
<p>We’ve moved from devastation to hopeful optimism, and we’re on our
way to inspiration, so overall, this whole experience might have been
more positive than negative — can’t go wrong with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another post about Robotology is in the works, sort of like a
post-mortem, although since it’s not dead, maybe it’s more akin to a
physical or routine check-up?</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for sticking with us, faithful readers, and stay tuned for more.</p>

				<p>Please
bear with us over the next little while, loyal readers — we’re shifting
our sites around and moving from our cheapass webhost to a proper
server, and there will probably be a few kinks to work out. Rest
assured, we’ll be back soon, and hopefully with a much more awesome
setup and less down-time on the sites!</p>
<p>We’ll keep you posted!</p>

				<p>We just finished making another video showing some of what we’ve been working on around here: walking robots! </p>
<p>See it here on <a href="http://vimeo.com/6805794" target="_blank">Vimeo (higher quality)</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHVyg2rDBy4" target="_blank">Youtube (lower quality)</a>.</p>
<p>(In case you missed it, you can check out the first video in <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=334" target="_blank">this</a> post.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics are of course still just debug stuff, and all collision
shapes are capsules, as this was much simpler than having to specify
polygonal shapes for each segment of each body. </p>
<p>The environment is also obviously not at all what the final game
world will be like, but as we haven’t yet implemented a camera we
aren’t able to do any scrolling; the treadmill and “hamster wheel”
scenes come in handy for testing extended walking <img src="metablog_files/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>It’s really exciting to finally feel like we’re getting somewhere,
after so much prep work establishing the foundation. We still have a
lot of work to do on physics-based animation, in terms of both
modelling and control, but it’s just great to finally be able to use
the systems we’ve spent so much time building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video, all movement is animation being driven based on time;
the next step in terms of modeling movement is to add some sort of
feedback to the system, since currently it’s all just blind forward
animation (i.e “wind-up toys”). Instead of being oblivious to physics,
the playhead driving the animation should be coupled to the physical
state of the robot so that, for example, if a robot’s foot is stuck on
something, the animation doesn’t just keep playing back regardless.
That would be silly! We have a few ideas but there aren’t any good
references around so we’ll be more or less stabbing in the dark. That’s
okay, we’re good at stabbing. Er, metaphorically.</p>
<p>Control also needs a lot of work; for the video we were just using
the keyboard to set the speed of the motors driving the animation, but
moving forward, some sort of higher-level controller which can steer
the motors is needed. There are thankfully a few good papers on
integrating high-level logical control with low-level continuous
control — hopefully it won’t be too complicated to add slightly more
intelligent brains to the robots!</p>
<p>We also have a lot of work to do on the tools side; we made a basic
parametric model which can generate legs and feet, but it’s quite
rudimentary and can’t handle, for instance, wheeled or flying robots.
Oh yeah, for sure we need wheeled and flying robots <img src="metablog_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley">
It’s definitely a huge improvement from hard-coding everything — making
a biped now only takes ~20 lines of code to define some parameters
which are then used to generate the necessary data, instead of 200+ to
make all the shapes and constraints by hand. But what we really can’t
wait for is when we finish a more visual editor which will make
defining custom shapes even less tedious <img src="metablog_files/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, that’s about it for now. How are you liking all these posts? It’s prolific around here!</p>
<p>We’re going to get back to working on the character controller (used
to model the movement of the player and smaller robots), and we have
about a month to get something playable done for the IGF deadline…it
will be tight, so maybe don’t expect much in the way of posting for a
little while!</p>

				<p>We recently received an interesting email from <a href="http://www.neurobehavioralservices.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Alterman</a>, a clinical psychologist certified in neurofeedback therapy. With his permission, here’s what he had to say:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Metanet Software,</p>
<p>I’d like to express my thanks for the important contribution your
game N has made to many of my patients. I am a clinical psychologist
specializing in neurobehavioral therapy for disorders of attention,
anxiety, and impulsivity in adolescents. For a portion of their mental
training, we run N on a PC with the AV signal channeled through a
switch that responds to the patient’s brainwaves or skin-conductance.
When the patient’s autonomic nervous system becomes excited or brain
becomes agitated beyond a certain threshold, the AV signal is
automatically cut-off and the game paused until the patient can again
play with perfect composure.</p>
<p>Better than any other game I’ve employed, N is beautifully adapted
for this purpose. In practice mode with the timer off, not only does
the game-play allow for pausing even at critical junctures whenever the
AV signal is interrupted, but the level design also allows me to teach
patients with learning disabilities and attention deficits how to
gather information from failure, identify new strategies, practice the
execution of those strategies, and then, following additional failures,
reassess their strategies or need for further skill acquisition. This
training teaches them meta-awareness which helps them to develop
frustration tolerance in real world academic and social environments in
a way that talk therapy alone does not.</p>
<p>So, thanks again for your fine work. It has made a substantial
difference in the lives of many young people and their families.
(Incidentally, they also really enjoy watching their N-body bounce
around after it becomes a corpse.)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>

<p>We were amazed and humbled to hear that; that N could be a part of something so progressive and cool is simply inspiring. </p>
<p>It would have been pretty awesome if we could have shipped N+ with
an AV switch peripheral, so that everyone could try this sort of
training…that’s a great idea for the sequel, whenever that happens! </p>
<p>Thanks for writing, Dr. Alterman, you rock! We’re happy we could help <img src="metablog_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other, less awesome news, the N+ DS/PSP community servers are
officially no more. We received word from our stalwart contact at Atari
that the valiant efforts to rescue the data servers for N+ DS and PSP
(from Silverbirch, the now-defunct developer of the handheld versions)
and reinstate them on-site at Atari have failed, and since the project
has unfortunately been something of a financial failure, the community
servers are not a priority and will now be abandoned. We fully
understand the decision on Atari’s part, and cannot fault them at all;
it just sucks for everyone awesome enough to buy the DS/PSP versions of
N+.</p>
<p>We are saddened by the news, since this marks the end of a (rather
short) era of sharing levels and playing multiplayer games on the
handheld systems, but we are not surprised; this was an inevitability
that we think unfortunately arrived long before it was due. Players
will have to be content with single player levels moving forward —
hopefully the quality and quantity there will suffice. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone, for playing N+. We hope you continue to enjoy
it! Let’s have a moment of silence for N+ DS and PSP’s online content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s it for today’s trip through the mailbag; coming “soon” (in
the next couple weeks): a new video of in-development Robotology stuff.
Mark your calendars for some vague date in the future!</p>

				<p>We’re
incredibly pressed for time today, so sadly this final daily post may
not be the detailed and frankly hilarious post you’ve come to expect.
If you’re just tuning into this blogstravaganza, <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">here</a> <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=390" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=351" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=433" target="_blank">links</a> you might want to check out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday we provided some insight into the other things we like to
spend our time doing, such as getting crafty, and subtly implied that
we’d be returning to the dev-related today. If you guessed that today’s
much anticipated topic is Robotology, you totally get 28 points. </p>
<p>We generally tend to vacillate between supreme confidence and
terrifying anxiety about this game. Despite months and months of work,
it’s still nowhere near complete, but at the same time we’ve managed to
get most of the vital parts figured out. Many of these systems are
currently up and running, and we’ve learned a <em>lot</em> in the process.</p>
<p>Our roadmap for the next few months is basically “crunch crunch
crunch” (mmm! sounds so delicious.) trying to get something complete
for the IGF deadline, and then crunch some more trying to get something
finished for the end of the year (our hard deadline with the sincerely
wonderful <a href="http://omdc.on.ca/" target="_blank">OMDC</a>). We also need to wrap up the Office Yeti prototype.</p>
<p>In order to meet these deadlines, we’ve spent the past week getting
organized so that we can properly apply some sort of triage to the
remaining tasks (we are getting <em>so</em> good at triage).
Previously we simply had lists of tasks in no particular order, broken
up only by topic (i.e graphics, editor, bugs, etc) which we would trawl
through randomly to find the next problem to work on; now we have a
nice hierarchical series of tasks which has been sorted according to
priority vis-a-vis our deadlines. </p>
<p>This was a somewhat depressing process, since it required cutting
features entirely, and postponing others for the foreseeable future;
still, it was ultimately worthwhile since we now know exactly what we
have to do in the immediate future, and moreover we know we <em>can</em> get it all done. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what specifically are we working on now? We’ve been stuck on
control and animation for a while; basically we have a great simulator
which lets us model motorized contraptions, but we now need to add
AI/logic which drives the motors in order to accomplish things. From
the high-level AI architecture to the low-level motor control, this is
a problem which isn’t very well documented — most people seem to be
content to have dynamics-based animation systems which amount to
ragdolls following keyframe animation data, and leave it at that. </p>
<p>This is itself is far from trivial to get working, but even harder
is figuring out some way to add feedback to the system, so that the
ragdoll isn’t being dragged forward blindly by animation playback, but
is instead controlled by a system which takes the current state of the
ragdoll into account. </p>
<p>Of course, once we do find a working strategy, the real challenge
will be to develop it into a flexible solution that can be applied to
the various types of mechanisms we want to control — we don’t want to
have to hand-code control systems from the ground up for each type of
robot or moving object! Yikes. Ideally we’ll be able to plug together
pre-existing control components to create each robot’s control system;
barring that, we’ll have a set of common control
functionality/utilities and then we’ll write each controller by hand
using this “toolbox” rather than from scratch. Still better than
nothing!</p>
<p>Aside from control, our other immediate task is getting a proper
graphics system up and running. We have various prototypes which
demonstrate that our basic ideas work, but we need to take these and
create a proper rendering pipeline. This <em>would</em> be a
relatively straightforward problem, except for our complete ignorance
of how graphics systems are typically organized — we’re used to having
this problem already taken care of by the Flash runtime, so we have no
idea where to even begin. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s about all we have time to get into right now,
unfortunately! We really can’t wait to write up some tutorials on
everything we’ve learned, but of course that will be a while since we
need to get the actual game done first <img src="metablog_files/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>And so ends the legendary blogathon. We accomplished pretty much
what we set out to, namely to get you readers up to date on where we’re
at, and to give our abysmal blog posting statistics a much-needed kick
in the ass. We’ll be back in the not-too-distant future with more news
about Robotology, hopefully with some more video or screenshots so you
can see how things are progressing along with the explanation. </p>
<p>That’s it for now! Thanks for reading, and for all your comments — we really appreciate it.</p>

				<p>For
those of you just joining us on our quest for daily blog posts so as to
show up our usually abysmal posting statistics, you can find <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">part 0</a>, <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=390" target="_blank">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=351" target="_blank">part 2</a> via those links.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we introduced you to the crazy world of Office Yeti, our <em>next </em>next
game, which will be released after Robotology (our next game). We hope
you enjoyed your brief stay there — a more in-depth look is on its way.</p>
<p>We also tried to imply that we do spend some time on more than just
games. Now, we know you’re used to seeing game- and dev-related posts
on this blog, but we’re going change it up a bit and switch gears
before we conclude our daily blog-posting extravaganza; let’s hope you
sharpened those link-finding skills back in <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=390" target="_blank">Blogathon post 1</a> — you’re gonna need ‘em!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At long last, there’s new stuff in the Metanet handmade merch shop! Can you believe it? </p>
<p>Long ago, when we had some extra time in the evenings, we spent some
of it devising and constructing simple but fantastic tote bags. We
currently use the prototypes for books, food, sundries and what have
you. Very durable, very cool. <a href="http://metanet.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Check ‘em out!</a></p>
<p>(Note that the contrast between fabric and ink is always fairly
stark — differences in the photos in our Etsy shop and the how-to below
are purely because of unusual lighting and the therefore necessary
screwing-around in Photoshop. Sorry, we’re n00bs!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something we like to do here at Metanet is to try to be creative in
non-computer-related ways such as making music, making short films and
making handmade merch — it takes the edge off coding all day and keeps
us motivated to get back. To give some insight into what we do when
we’re not making games, playing games or hanging out with Socialites,
indies and other Toronto friends, here’s a brief look at how we made
the fabulous Metanet tote bags, in 15 Steps of Varying Difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s start with the Metanet logo patches. To make the screen, we
used the incredible Print Gocco, a Japanese screen-printing machine we
bought in Japan on our first trip. It’s regrettably no longer being
produced; supplies are scarce, and each print makes us appreciate how
cool it is even more. Here’s an action shot of Mare <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/print_gocco.jpg" target="_blank">burning a screen</a>. SO COOL. This is the <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/1-make_a_screen.jpg" target="_blank">screen</a>. It’s <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/3-screen.jpg" target="_blank">transparent</a> where the ink comes through, obviously.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>We cut out pieces of fabric to print on, and <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/4-print.jpg" target="_blank">printed the image</a> using black <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/2-ink_and_squeegee.jpg" target="_blank">screenprinting ink and a squeegee</a> (really, we’re using a chef’s plastic scraper thingy from a kitchen store. Works just as well!).
<p>We’re going for a distressed/deliberately messy effect, so even
minor misprints are okay. Interestingly, that eliminates a lot of
stress, which leads to better prints. Win-win!</p>
<p>After <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/5-remove_screen.jpg" target="_blank">removing the screen</a>, you’re left with glistening, clean lines and a strong sense of satisfaction. Let’s take a <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/6-cu_print.jpg" target="_blank">closer look</a> at that delicious print. It’s even cooler in person.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>We <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/7-repeat_prints.jpg" target="_blank">repeated</a> the previous step approximately one billion times, on various pieces of fabric. Gotta use that screen while it’s wet!</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Next we <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/8-cut.jpg" target="_blank">trim</a> the excess fabric. <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/9-repeat_cut.jpg" target="_blank">Over and over</a>. Again, the deliberately messy aesthetic we’re going for means we don’t have to worry about perfectly straight cuts. Nice!</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>And now on to the bag itself. Washing, drying, and <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/11-iron_fabric.jpg" target="_blank">ironing fabric</a>
is the first step. Or series of steps, really. We used various weights,
colours and prints of cotton canvas for durability and variety. </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>We cut out fabric <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/12-pattern.jpg" target="_blank">based on a pattern</a>
and with the help of some rocks (nature’s fabric weights). The bags are
unlined, so only one piece is necessary. Our pattern has gone through
several revisions as you can see by the masking tape!</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>We painstakingly <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/14-cut_straps.jpg" target="_blank">measured and cut</a> black webbing for each bag’s handles. We bought webbing in <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/13-roll_of_webbing.jpg" target="_blank">bulk</a>
because it is cheaper that way, and more awesome. That roll was twice
as big when we started this project, and was oodles of fun to roll
around the office. We got two and raced ‘em. When you’re working with
nylon or poly webbing, don’t forget to melt the cut ends so they won’t
unravel.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Here we are <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/15-sew_patch1.jpg" target="_blank">sewing a Metanet logo patch</a> to <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/16-sew_patch2.jpg" target="_blank">bag fabric</a>.
Fraying of the patch’s edges suits the style we’re going for, so
turning the edges under isn’t required. By Grabthar’s Hammer, what a
savings.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Next, we <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/17-iron_patch.jpg" target="_blank">iron the patch</a>
to make it sit smooth and flat, and additionally to further set the
ink. This may seem superfluous, but it’s the little details that make
these bags special.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>We sew the side seams <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/18-sew_side_seams1.jpg" target="_blank">right-side-out first</a>, then iron and <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/19-sew_side_seams2.jpg" target="_blank">sew the sides again</a> with the bag turned inside out. Why? <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/20-french_seam.jpg" target="_blank">French seams</a>,
bitches! French seams are very strong, plus they conceal the cut edges
of the fabric on both sides of the bag, so the seams will look neat and
won’t fray or fall apart. French seams: another innovation brought to
you by Metanet Software.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>While the bag is inside out, it’s a good time to <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/21-corner_point.jpg" target="_blank">fold the bottom edges into corners</a>. Then we <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/22-measure_corners.jpg" target="_blank">measure</a>
and sew them down. Et voila, a simple square gusset that will enable
the bag to, for example, hold several textbooks side by side.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Next we <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/23-iron_hem.jpg" target="_blank">iron the top hem</a>. Ironing is essential for easy sewing later on.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>The handles are then <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/24-measure_handles.jpg" target="_blank">positioned and pinned</a>, making sure they <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/25-match_handles.jpg" target="_blank">match up</a>.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Almost there. The <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/26-sew_hem.jpg" target="_blank">top hem is next</a>.
French seams in cotton canvas can be tough for domestic machines so we
mainly avoided them; we invested in more horsepower for the MKII totes
for a different sort of finishing. Not to worry, several from the MKI
run have been in use for a year now and are holding up impeccably.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Finally, we <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/27-tag.jpg" target="_blank">hand-drew some fancy logos on the tag</a>, trimmed, and marvelled at each <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/28-finished.jpg" target="_blank">finished Metanet tote bag</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From step 6 on, each bag takes about 30 minutes to put together. Not
too shabby! And as for the bags themselves, well they’re not shabby at
all. Except the logo patches, but it’s a controlled shabby <img src="metablog_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> Here’s <a href="http://metanetsoftware.com/images/metanet_bags_how_to/29-mare_bag.jpg" target="_blank">another bag</a>
Mare made for herself using a slightly different technique. Yes, it’s
just that fun to make tote bags. Who knows, maybe this will inspire
you, brave reader, to get crafty too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow will probably be the final daily post — we’re starting to run out of <em>material</em>! Yes, that was a craft-related pun. </p>
<p>Hopefully this brief spate of posts will get us back in the habit of
posting more frequently than once every two months — it definitely
reminded us how fun it is to write. We’re <em>really</em> excited
about writing up tutorials on some of the stuff we’ve been working on
for Robotology; sadly we need to finish the actual game first, and a
lot remains to be done on that front.</p>
<p>Was the previous sentence an example of foreshadowing?! Tune in tomorrow for the exciting conclusion of <em>The Blogathon</em>.</p>

			<p><b>By M&amp;R</b> | September 9, 2009 </p>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Those
of you who only check this blog once a month — a perfectly reasonable
strategy, given our previous rate of posting — will be shocked to know
that this is in fact our <em>third consecutive daily post!</em> We can’t believe it either! (Here are links to <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">part 0</a> and <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=390" target="_blank">part 1</a> of the daily blogathon, in case you’re just tuning in.)</p>
<p>Those of you who <em>have</em> read the previous post may recall that the most salient news item was the recent <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/social/hand-eye-society-the-quadrocial-social-4/" target="_blank&quot;">Hand Eye Society Social #4 (the “Quadrocial”)</a>, and the many exciting voyages and adventures which arose as a result of said event. </p>
<p>Those of you who managed to read all the way to the end may even
remember a passing mention of our presentation at the Social; this was
the “cliffhanger” of yesterday’s post… <em>OR WAS IT ?!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it was. We just wanted to throw in another little cliffhanger
there, just to make sure that we really milked this sweet mystery thing
for all its worth. And so, without further prolonging what must seem
like an agonizing eternity of prelude, we’re happy to announce: <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/images/misc/yetilogo.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/images/misc/yetilogo.jpg" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/images/misc/yetilogo.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>OFFICE YETI</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brief aside on the subject of the title of this post: those of you
not familiar with Star Trek and/or our forums may not be aware that,
prior to our formal announcement of its existence, Robotology was
simply referred to as “TNG” (short for “The Next Generation”)*. </p>
<p>Thus the code-name that was selected as most appropriate for the
game which — assuming we have our druthers (we’re rifling through
drawers and looking under furniture for them right now, but not to
worry, we’re sure they’re around here somewhere) — will succeed
Robotology was naturally <em>Deep Space 9</em> (neatly abbreviated to “DS9″). </p>
<p>Of course as this was a purely private code-word, intended for
internal use only, and we had already decided upon the proper title
(for reasons which will become obvious once we reach the conclusion of
this aside), the formal code-name DS9 was never actually used. In
hindsight, the entire exercise in code-naming could therefore be
considered somewhat frivolous, but that’s how we roll around here —
such is our wont.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what <em>is</em> Office Yeti?</p>
<p>Office Yeti, which we’ve been prototyping lately, is a single-player
action/puzzle/simulation game in which players assume control of a yeti
who works in an office. </p>
<p>But, you may be asking, how did HR come to inadvertently hire a
yeti? Why a Yeti, and not a Sasquatch? Is this all some sort of
hilarious inside joke? </p>
<p>For now these questions will all remain unanswered; the important
point is that you’re a tiny little character in a tiny little simulated
office building full of even tinier characters and objects, all of
which are going about their business more or less oblivious to the fact
that you are, to put it bluntly, non-human. Just like in an office in
real life!</p>
<p>The game we’re most drawing inspiration from is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skool_Daze" target="_blank">Skool Daze</a>, which is sadly not that well known despite having both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Skool" target="_blank">a sequel</a> and <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/rjordan/klass/" target="_blank">an excellent Windows remake</a>.</p>
<p>A quasi-mathematical graphic description of the game might look something like:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skool_Daze" target="_blank">[Skool Daze]</a> + <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/harry/" target="_blank">[Harry the Handsome Executive]</a> + <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/images/misc/logo.gif" target="_blank">[Metanet]</a> = <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/images/misc/yetilogo.jpg" target="_blank">[Office Yeti]</a></p>
<p>Other games we’re drawing from include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampage_%28arcade_game%29" target="_blank">Rampage</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr6nKpCJC1Y" target="_blank">Factory</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great premise, right? We’ve only been working on this part-time for
the past few months, so there isn’t much to show yet; we have the
basics of the physical simulation working (objects moving around and
colliding), some basic objects mocked up, a prototyped graphics system,
and a good shared vision of the general direction we want to take
things. Hopefully the next time we post about it, we’ll have some
screenshots or something to show — for now it’s all under wraps.
Delicious, delicious wraps.</p>
<p>We’ve already hit our first big snag: depth-sorting a 3D scene is
apparently not as trivial as we had assumed it would be! Luckily we
managed to find a solution which is working so far, and which we should
be able to extend as the need arises. We’ve always wanted to try
non-perspective-projection 3D, and the oblique angle we’ve settled upon
is totally exciting for us…a third dimension!! That’s one more than our
typical amount!</p>
<p>The actual game mechanics at this point are quite vague; we have a
long list of things to prototype, but its impossible to say what will
end up working and what won’t. Our first goal is to get a simple little
artificial-life office simulation working; from there we’ll drop in a
big ol’ yeti and see what happens. We’re expecting hilarious mayhem.</p>
<p>The general idea is that the yeti is free to interact with the
environment just like a normal worker, but also has a unique set of
abilities: eating people, climbing walls, smashing things — you know,
typical yeti behaviours.</p>
<p>The graphic design will be quite iconic, similar to instructional
data-graphics such as airplane safety cards or warning signs; the
movement and physical interaction of objects will — hopefully — combine
to create sort of a “living shopping-mall-map” effect.</p>
<p>As many of you may know, we’re also hoping to work with our friend <a href="http://www.edmundm.com/" target="_blank">Edmund McMillen</a>,
whose art has always stood out in our minds as awesome. We’re not sure
yet on specifics — the ball has just started to roll — but we’re pretty
confident we can figure something out despite being roughly in opposite
corners of North America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office Yeti was actually conceived of long before Robotology, or
even N; at the time we were both working in offices and thought that it
was a really rich and under-explored setting for a game; also it was
fun to fantasize about various ways that havoc could be wreaked upon an
office environment.</p>
<p>We then came across Skool Daze (thanks to the truly wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_of_the_Underdogs" target="_blank">Home of the Underdogs</a>),
which is an amazing example of taking a game and setting it in the
middle of a simulation, with the simulation simply being the
setting/backdrop of the game rather than the direct focus.</p>
<p>Of course, we realized that we had no hope of being able to make the
game that we wanted, so we kept the idea on the back-burner until such
a time as both our own skills and the chosen development environment
(Flash, so that people can play while they’re at work, naturally) were
capable of handling that much awesome all in one go. </p>
<p>Finally, that day came — we were at a point with Robotology where
getting the game done was more a matter of “when” rather than “if”; the
hardest problems had been solved, and we just needed time to iterate on
the game design until things clicked. Thus we decided that it was the
perfect time to start Office Yeti.</p>
<p>And that, dear readers, is your official introduction to our next project. We’ll keep you posted!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time on the Metablog: is that all? What <em>else</em> have we been doing this year?!</p>
<p>footnotes:<br>
[*]: TNG is actually an abbreviation of “The Next Game”, but to
acknowledge this would completely ruin all of our hilarious Star Trek
jokes, and so instead we choose to ignore it.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>For
those of you just tuning in, this is the second part of our spectacular
series of daily blog posts; the first part (part 0) is <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Yes, daily updates.. it’s exciting! </p>
<p>Today’s post was really meant to <em>precede</em> the events on
which it is based, however we unfortunately weren’t able to find time
while everything was going down. Those of you with a gift for detecting
hyperlinks may have already discovered the topic of today’s post
cleverly hidden in post 0; kudos to you! The rest of you will want to
pay special attention to words in this and other posts which appear
ever-so-slightly darker than the rest of the text: Surprise! Those are
links. And there are a lot of them in this post, so please be
ever-vigilant — in fact the very first sentence of this very post
contains one! In-post minigames: that’s our gift to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with some history: a while ago, a friend of ours, <a href="http://nomediakings.org/about" target="_blank">Jim Munroe</a>, decided he didn’t already have enough to do; apparently <a href="http://www.nomediakings.org/IMadeMain.htm" target="_blank">book authoring</a>, <a href="http://nomediakings.org/press/therefore_repent.html" target="_blank">graphic novel writing</a>, <a href="http://nomediakings.org/artsygames/" target="_blank">artsy games incubating</a>, <a href="http://www.infestwisely.com/" target="_blank">movie producing</a>, and baby making (this last feat strangely absent from his “What I’ve Made” page) weren’t enough for him <img src="metablog_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> He also wanted to inspire all the local game-developy people into joining some sort of alliance. A code-alition, if you will. </p>
<p>(Fun fact: any random selection of 5 people in and around the
Greater Toronto Area will contain no fewer than 3 people who know Jim
Munroe, each through a completely different channel than the others.
This is the origin of the popular party game “2 Degrees of Jim Munroe”)</p>
<p>So, Jim rounded us developy-types up and started <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/whats-this-about/" target="_blank">The Hand-Eye Society</a>, convincing us of its merits using beer and superior logic. </p>
<p>(Aside: Raigan debated the chosen name, proffering (and preferring)
alternative titles for the organization such as “TOTOromi” and “Toronto
Indie Games Source”; in doing so he only narrowly avoided being the
first member subject to mass shunning.)</p>
<p>(Another aside: Now might be a good time to introduce another
in-post minigame: see if you can guess which statements are real and
which are confabulations!) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So: having established the existence of the Hand Eye Society, we can
now explain that there is a bi-monthly event referred to as The Hand
Eye Society Social (Raigan’s suggested nom-de-event was “Gameboree”),
located at a well-hidden local bar in which Socialites (that’s what we
call each other) present in-development games and other items of
interest to appease a usually jeering, unruly crowd. </p>
<p>Each Social is hosted by a different Socialite; those whose
offerings are accepted are hoisted aloft and feted until the wee hours;
those whose presentations are deemed unworthy are, or course, shunned. </p>
<p>We gave a quick summary of a project we’re currently working on, and flew in our friend Alex Austin — <a href="http://crypticsea.com/" target="_blank">whose games you’re probably aware of</a>
— as the evening’s main event. In fairness this clever strategy was not
of our own devising, we merely adopted the practice from the original
Social host (Jim Munroe, again.. that guy is everywhere!) of <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/social/the-first-social/" target="_blank">inviting a foreigner to face the crowd</a>.</p>
<p>And so it was that Alex found himself not in his native California,
but on strange, unfamiliar soil, in an alien climate so frigid that he
was forced to bundle up in a jacket and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuque" target="_blank">tuque</a>
(apparently called “beanies” in the US), despite it being the middle of
summer. Seriously, it’s not usually cold like that in the summer up
here, that was really unexpected! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/mystery_back.jpg" target="_blank">Here we can see Alex proceeding through Canadian customs.</a> (the Sentinel II air-blasting system is at this point only ceremonial.)</p>
<p>Here’s Alex as <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/mystery_front.jpg" target="_blank">an anonymous informant providing testimony from a mysterious lair in the sky</a>. We dragged Alex to <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/hangin.jpg" target="_blank">various parties and get-togethers</a> around the city. Here he is <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/building.jpg" target="_blank">crushing one of our many buildings</a>, perhaps in response.</p>
<p>Amongst the countless atrocities he was forced to endure during his
stay, surely none was more abhorrent to such a freedom-loving soul than
our terrifying socialist system of alcohol purveyance. <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/beer.jpg" target="_blank">Here he is, looking suitably stricken.</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the magical night of the Social finally arrived, Alex gave the assembled Toronto Game Friends a behind-the-scenes look at <a href="http://crypticsea.com/noquarter/" target="_blank">the multitude</a> of <a href="http://crypticsea.com/anewzero/index.html" target="_blank">incredible games</a> he’s <a href="http://crypticsea.com/somnia/index.html" target="_blank">working on</a>
right now, leaving everyone impressed and motivated. He’s making
roughly a dozen different games at the same time! It’s somewhat
daunting; we can only assume it’s the fresh California air which allows
such prodigious feats.</p>
<p>And so, Alex’s presentation won over the audience, and he enjoyed
the rest of a successful, though frigid, weekend in Toronto before
returning to the balmy state he calls home. Thanks again, Alex, it was
so awesome to have you in town!</p>
<p>This Social was an historic moment for many reasons. For instance, it was the very first Social attended by the infamous <a href="http://www.mathewkumar.com/" target="_blank">Mathew Kumar</a>,
an investigative games journalist embedded here in Toronto. It was also
the very first fourth Social, a feat which will probably never be
duplicated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’ve brought you up to speed on the Hand Eye Society,
which concludes the second, and still quite over-long (we’re working on
it!), daily blogathon post.</p>
<p><em>Next time:</em> what of Metanet’s presentation at the Social? </p>
<p>Which game did we present? (infuriatingly vague hint: it was not Robotology!)</p>

				<p>It
was pointed out in the comments that we average a paltry 5 blog posts a
year at this rate. That is beyond terrible and we apologize
wholeheartedly. It seems like on every blog post we earnestly promise
to post more often, and then two months go by and we still haven’t
found the time. This time, we mean it — this time, we have a plan! </p>
<p>So prepare yourself, brave reader, for the stupendous onslaught of…<br>
<br>
<strong>DAILY POSTS ON THE METABLOG!!</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right: for the next several days we vow to post every
single day. In a row. Not only will this enable us to write individual
blog posts which are less book-like in stature, it should also help to
bolster our woefully low rate of posts-per-year. In your face,
statistics! </p>
<p>On a more practical note, part of the problem with our lack of
timely blog posting is that it takes a disproportionate amount of time
to write a post — it seems like it should take an hour at most and then
we find much of the day has gone by and it’s still not done. This
particular post had been especially daunting since, as time passed,
there were more and more things to write about, creating a snowballing
infinite loop of blog-posting-procrastination. For reasons which we’ll
hopefully get to at some later date, spending the entire day writing a
blog post wasn’t really going to work.</p>
<p>Hence our insanely brilliant discovery of the idea to post smaller
amounts at a daily rate, thereby avoiding the infinite regress of
non-daily-blog-posting. Daily blogging: another mind-blowing innovation
brought to you by Metanet Software Inc.</p>
<p>So fear no longer, for the time has come: post we shall, and with
gusto! And about more than just the fact that yes, we are indeed
finally posting something; despite our name, most of the time we do try
not to be <em>too </em>meta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s item of interest: <strong>XBLA game rating</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who aren’t on the cutting edge of console
OS/interface updates, some background: a ratings system was recently
added to XBLA, allowing players to assign each game a rating of 1 to 5
stars, either via the 360’s menu system or <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841085c/" target="_blank">the website</a>. </p>
<p>This is a really welcome feature, since it will (hopefully) prevent
the worthwhile games from getting buried under new releases. In the
Community Games section (”Indie Games” now, apparently) this was
especially a problem, so kudos to Microsoft for enabling this feature —
we’re sure it caused their lawyers many a sleepless night. Or
something. Who knows why it wasn’t implemented earlier — the point is,
it’s here now, and that’s awesome!</p>
<p>Of course, for some inexplicable reason the actual implementation
seems to be half-finished, or perhaps half-broken, since you can rate
games you haven’t bought or even downloaded the demo for… but it’s
better than nothing, right? Right? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get to the actual point: so far, 11k people have rated N+, and we
were delighted to find that its rating is quite good. Thank you so
much! This is definitely a great start, but we were a touch
underwhelmed (if that’s a word) by the math: it turns out that means
that less than 1% of gamers who have tried N+ have given it a rating.</p>
<p>We briefly considered some sort of “cash for votes” program, but it
was quickly abandoned due some pretty obvious problems; aside from the
glaring ethical (and possibly legal) issues, the volume of XBLA users
(well over 10M by now) means that even at payments as low as 10 cents
per star, we could very quickly become superbankrupt. (Superbankruptcy
is like regular bankruptcy, except that subsequently the company may
form a neutron star or black hole.) </p>
<p>In light of the above, we’re just humbly asking everyone to rate N+
with however many stars they feel it deserves. Please take a few
minutes, rate N+, and spread the word — every little bit helps! <img src="metablog_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concludes the first of many daily posts which shall be forthcoming on this, the Metablog. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what adventures await us tomorrow? </p>
<p>What exactly is the elusive “Hand Eye Society”, and what transpired on the evening of August 27th, 2009?<br>
(spoilers: <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/whats-this-about/" target="_blank">this is</a> and <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/social/hand-eye-society-the-quadrocial-social-4/" target="_blank">this did</a>) </p>
<p>Will Mare and Raigan ever learn how to write posts of a lesser verbosity?</p>
<p>And what of <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/mystery_back.jpg" target="_blank">the identity</a> of this  <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/misc/mystery_front.jpg" target="_blank">mysterious foreigner</a> in our midst? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tune in tomorrow for more of the incredible postings of Mare and
Raigan! Same bat-URL, hopefully similar bat-time. (Okay that sentence
was hard to write. Being unabashedly cheesy and ridiculous is harder
than it looks!)</p>
